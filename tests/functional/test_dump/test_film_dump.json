Now, he's Hollywood's punchline about everything wrong with people who were famous as children. All Dickie Roberts wants to do is find that one gig that will restore his honor and everyone's love of him, so after learning that Rob Reiner's making an ambitious new movie destined to sweep the Oscars, Dickie's first in line to audition. He walks out having learned he certainly looks the part but can't act it... yet, owing to his very unusual childhood. To research the role, Dickie embarks on a bizarre scheme to live with a suburban family to see how the average American child lives, having them put him up as their \"son\". But once his gloves are off, Dickie discovers how great it is to be part of a true family, and whether he gets the part or not, his attempt at method acting will certainly change his life forever.","directors":[{"id":"24f48dd1-c19b-4a78-aa05-1b2db0235296","full_name":"Sam Weisman"}],"actors":[{"id":"c358242d-2dd3-4fd4-afa7-dc187854a59b","full_name":"David Spade"},{"id":"0d1d24d6-9840-4519-8e7b-dabca3970ae0","full_name":"Scott Terra"},{"id":"a02640da-38c3-4796-b1bf-37d7c4d37344","full_name":"Mary McCormack"}],"writers":[{"id":"c358242d-2dd3-4fd4-afa7-dc187854a59b","full_name":"David Spade"}]}}
